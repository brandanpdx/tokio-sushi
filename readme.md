# Tokio Sushi

## Epicodus Independent Capstone Project
## By: Brandan Sayarath

## Project Concept and Proposal

Tokio is a fictional sushi restaurant in New York City.  To stay consistent with the high-end theme of the restaurant, I will build out a very modern user interface.   

Since this project only has a front-end design, I will be putting a lot of time into the wireframing and planning of the site.  

- I will document why I used certain typefaces or color palettes to achieve the design goals of the website. 

- Header with main photo as focal point with sans-serif typeface

- Collapsible hamburger nav-bar that scrolls up/down alongside the user

- Cards with various food items and hover animation showing their prices and ordering options

- Social media and copyright links in the footer

- Fully responsive with media queries 


## Wireframe (TBD)
