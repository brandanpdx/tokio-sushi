# Project Concept and Proposal

Tokio is a fictional sushi restaurant in New York City.  To stay true to the high-end theme of the restaurant, I will build out a very modern user interface.   

# Wireframing 
Wireframing is most effective at the beginning of every design process, when the main objective is creating the product’s structure.

Designers use wireframes to outline visual and typographic hierarchy on user interfaces, plan transitions and interactions, and organize the general interface in order to deliver the most valuable information to their team — and ultimately the end users.


## Rough Sketch 
A UI sketch is the absolute best way to make sure that you’ve worked through all the possible options and found the most effective, user-friendly way to express your interface idea.

## Low-Fidelity Wireframe
Low fidelity wireframes are created in a monochrome or grayscale palette. While low fidelity wireframes can still be created manually, using digital tools to create more detailed and realistic UI components can also be meaningful for understanding how some aesthetic details could merge with essential functionalities.

## High-Fidelity Wireframe

High fidelity wireframes take more effort to create, but they are effective in that they reveal how a product will look at project completion. High fidelity wireframes are created solely with digital tools.

The core difference from the other types of wireframes is that high fidelity wireframes are built in with color and present screens that are closer to how they would appear in final version of the software.
