# Project: Tokio Sushi

## Project's Purpose or Goal:
* Tokio is a fictional sushi restaurant in New York City.  To stay consistent with the high-end theme of the restaurant, I will build out a very modern user interface.  

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Since this project only has a front-end design, I will be putting a lot of time into the wireframing and planning of the site.  I will document why I used certain typefaces or color palettes to achieve the design goals of the website.  
* Header with main photo as focal point with sans-serif typeface 
* Collapsible hamburger nav-bar that scrolls up/down alongside the user
* Cards with various food items and hover animation showing their prices and ordering options
* Social media and copyright links in the footer
* Fully responsive with media queries 

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* HTML
* CSS
* Sass for transpiling CSS variables, nested rules, inline imports.  This will keep the CSS DRY and maintainable. 
* Figma for wire-framing
* Photoshop for creating custom assets

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Convert the entire site into React with JSX and JSX Styled Components
* Implement a reservation system that emails the user their reservation details
* Refactor the website to stay (WCAG) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines compliant

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* React
* OpenTable Reservation Widget
* WebAIM Contrast Checker

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

* While this course has been great for learning full-stack, I feel like honing more into my CSS skills.  Specifically with Flexbox and CSS grid.  Eventually, I would like to land a UI/UX job, and I want this capstone to let people know that I am not a developer without any taste, or a designer who doesn't know how to code.
